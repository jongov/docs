The [MainConcept Live Encoder](https://www.mainconcept.com/live-encoder) is a powerful all-in-one encoding engine designed to simplify common broadcast and OTT video workflows. With renowned MainConcept software HEVC and AVC codecs with optional GPU decoding as well as encoding powered by NVIDIA and Intel Quick Sync Video built in, the intuitive user interface or the flexible REST API allows you to package content for multiscreen delivery, using common input sources, in real-time. 

You can set up a live workflow to ingest, prepare, and stream audio-visual content that is compatible with every type of consumer device. It doesnâ€™t matter if you are delivering video directly to a CDN, to an online video platform via RTMP or with low-latency protocols Zixi and SRT, the Live Encoder ensures your live video is delivered reliably and in the highest possible quality. 

Besides MPEG-H 3D Audio creation, the software features many output streaming protocols like RTMP, RTSP, Zixi, SRT, TS over UDP/HTTP, MPEG-DASH, HLS and MP4 archiving files. The Live Encoder can be used in both contribution and distribution encoding workflows. 

This version of the MainConcept Live Encoder is a free demo version. It adds a watermark to the processed video and mutes audio from time to time. If you are interested in deploying the full version of the Live Encoder, please contact [sales@mainconcept.com](mailto:sales@mainconcept.com).

## Getting Started after Deployment

Once your MainConcept Live Encoder Marketplace App is deployed, you can log into the MainConcept Live Encoder Dashboard in your browser.

1. Open a browser and navigate to the domain you created in the beginning of your deployment. If you did not use a domain, you can use your Compute Instance's rDNS, which may look like the example below:

    ```
    203-0-113-1.ip.linodeusercontent.com
    ```

    See the [Managing IP Addresses](/docs/guides/managing-ip-addresses/#configuring-rdns) guide for information on viewing and configuring your rDNS.

2. Once the login prompt loads, enter `admin` as the *Username* and `admin` as the *Password*.
